# TODO

- Find way to do single table inheritance with Entitytled and apply to expression 
  terms to cleanup form mapping in expression term controllers.
- Make placeholders in suggestion/statement templates safe referentially.
- Decide what to do with FTK import code (replace HtmlCleaner with scala library? 
  move to model? remove from application?).
- Cleanup drugs controller (find way to make relationship serialization, and
  especially deserialization, work nicely).
- Replace DataTables with custom pagination (Entitytled extension?) and searching.
